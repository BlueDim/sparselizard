This code is at its origin a fork (origin: gitlab.onelab.info) of a GPL-licensed
code developed by Alexandre Halbach at University of Liege, Belgium in the applied
and computational electromagnetics departement (ACE).
It therefore follows the same GPL license as the originally forked code. 
The copyright of the original code goes to University of Liege and licensing
of the original forked code must be discussed with them.
